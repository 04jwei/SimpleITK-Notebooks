{"name":"SimpleITK Notebooks","tagline":"IPython Notebooks for learning how to use SimpleITK","body":"# SimpleITK Notebooks\r\n\r\nThis is a collection of IPython Notebooks, designed for tutorials, presentations and demonstration of using SimpleITK in the \"pylab\" environment for interactive image process.\r\n\r\n[SimpleITK](http://www.simpleitk.org) is an abstraction layer and wrapper around the [Insight Toolkit](http://www.itk.org) for many languages including python.\r\n\r\n# View Static Converted Pages\r\n\r\n[01 Image Basics](http://simpleitk.github.io/SimpleITK-Notebooks/01_Image_Basics.html)  \r\n[02 Pythonic Image](http://simpleitk.github.io/SimpleITK-Notebooks/02_Pythonic_Image.html)  \r\n[10 plotlib's imshow](http://simpleitk.github.io/SimpleITK-Notebooks/10_matplotlib's_imshow.html)  \r\n[20 Expand With Interpolators](http://simpleitk.github.io/SimpleITK-Notebooks/20_Expand_With_Interpolators.html)  \r\n[21 Transform and Resampling](http://simpleitk.github.io/SimpleITK-Notebooks/21_Transform_and_Resampling.html)  \r\n[30 Segmentation Region Growing](http://simpleitk.github.io/SimpleITK-Notebooks/30_Segmentation_Region_Growing.html)  \r\n[31 Levelset Segmentation](http://simpleitk.github.io/SimpleITK-Notebooks/31_Levelset_Segmentation.html)  \r\n[32 Watershed Segmentation](http://simpleitk.github.io/SimpleITK-Notebooks/32_Watersheds_Segmentation.html)  \r\n\r\n\r\n# Getting Started\r\n\r\nFor general information about installing SimpleITK please see the [SimpleITK wiki](http://www.itk.org/Wiki/ITK/Release_4/SimpleITK/GettingStarted).\r\n\r\n## Additional Data Download\r\n\r\nAdditionally the SPL's \"Multi-modality MRI-based Atlas of the Brain\" should be downloaded and extracted into the SimpleITK-Notebooks/Data directory.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.spl.harvard.edu/publications/item/view/2037\r\n\r\n\r\n## Setting Up a Python Environment\r\n\r\nIt is recommended to setup a separate Python virtual environment to run through these notebooks as a tutorial.\r\n\r\nUnder the best of circumstances (tested on OSX 10.8 and 10.7.5, RH6, Ubuntu 12) this environment can be setup with the following:\r\n\r\n    sudo pip install virtualenv\r\n    virtualenv ~/sitkpy --no-site-packages\r\n    ~/sitkpy/bin/pip install ipython[all]\r\n    ~/sitkpy/bin/pip install numpy\r\n    ~/sitkpy/bin/pip install matplotlib\r\n\r\nNote: On Linux platforms you may be able to obtain many of these packages as system packages which may suffice ( Ubuntu 12+).\r\nNote: On Window platforms some of these packages should be obtained as binary downloads and installed.\r\n\r\n### Install SimpleITK\r\n\r\nFor many common platforms, a built distribution is available as an Python egg. This can be downloading and installed with the following command:\r\n\r\n    ~/sitkpy/bin/easy_install SimpleITK\r\n \r\n\r\nAs of this writing, SimpleITK version >=0.6r1 is required to run these notebooks. This version currently needs to be downloaded from [Source Forge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/simpleitk/files/SimpleITK/0.6.rc1/Python/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Run the environment\r\n \r\nTo launch:\r\n\r\n    cd SimpleITK-Notebooks\r\n    ~/sitkpy/bin/ipython notebook --pylab=inline\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
