[SimpleITK](https://itk.org/Wiki/SimpleITK) is an abstraction layer and wrapper around the [Insight Toolkit](http://www.itk.org) for many languages including C++, Python, R, Java, C#, Lua, Tcl and Ruby.

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks, designed for tutorials and  presentations and to demonstrate the use of SimpleITK for interactive image analysis.

Notebooks are written in Python and R (see respective directories).
