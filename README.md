[SimpleITK](https://itk.org/Wiki/SimpleITK) is an abstraction layer and wrapper around the [Insight Toolkit](http://www.itk.org) for many languages including C++, Python, R, Java, C#, Lua, Tcl and Ruby.

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks, designed for tutorials and  presentations. The notebooks demonstrate the use of SimpleITK for interactive image analysis using the Python and R programming languages.

For additional language specific details see the README files in the respective directories ([Python details](Python/README.md), [R details](R/README.md)).

The animation below is a visualization of a rigid CT/MR registration process
created with SimpleITK and Python (the [script](Utilities/intro_animation.py) used to generate the frames for the animated gif is found in the repository's Utilities directory).
